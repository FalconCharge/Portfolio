            Hello, I'm Ben Harper, a second-year computer science student at UPEI in PEI. 
            I've always been passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems, which is why I'm pursuing a career as a developer. 
            I'm particularly fascinated by the possibilities of making a computer do whatever you want and exploring self-learning AI.
            I believe these areas hold immense potential for innovation and creativity in the field of software development. 
            I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on
        </p>
